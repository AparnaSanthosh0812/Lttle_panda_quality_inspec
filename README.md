Exploring Data for Actionable Insights ✨

I’m thrilled to share a glimpse of my recent project, where I analyzed a dataset using tools like Excel, Python, and Power BI. 🧑‍💻 Here's what I accomplished:

✅ Data Cleaning: Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis by identifying and handling inconsistencies using Python and Excel.
✅ Pivot Tables: Leveraged Excel to summarize key trends effectively.
✅ Visualizations: Used Power BI to create interactive dashboards, uncovering patterns and insights that drive better decision-making.

This project was not just about applying technical skills but also about honing my ability to interpret and communicate data-driven stories. 🎯

Looking forward to tackling more challenging datasets and contributing to impactful decisions through analytics! 📊
